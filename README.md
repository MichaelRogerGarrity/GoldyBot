# GoldyBot
This is a bot for Discord. In case you are unfamiliar with it, Discord is a voice and instant messaging platform centered around creating community-oriented servers. These servers can be as large as thousands of people, or just a small group of close friends. Bots can be added to servers to do all sorts of cool things and enhance the general experience of using Discord (or in most cases, just goof around). As for how the bot functions: in short, it reads messages sent in the text chat channels and parses them, looking for specific commands. The bot then responds accordingly to the commands with a wide variety of behaviors (for now, only in the form of text messages and embedded images). 

Here is an example of what one particular command would look like:

This bot was my first project using Python code. I had never tried it before, having used primarily Java and C in the past, so I figured it would be a fun project to familiarize myself with the language. I also learned quite a bit about using API and reading .json data. The bot is a whole lot of fun to use in my private servers with my friends, and is already full of inside jokes.

A full list of the commands used to control the bot can be found below:

$duffy - Monkey time (inside joke)
